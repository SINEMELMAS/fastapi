FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It was created by Sebastián Ramírez and is designed to be easy to use, while providing powerful features. Here are some key points about FastAPI:

1. **Fast Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, comparable to Node.js and Go, thanks to its asynchronous support and use of Starlette for the web parts.

2. **Easy to Use**: It has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for developers to build APIs quickly. FastAPI automatically validates request and response data, reducing boilerplate code.

3. **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using OpenAPI. You can access it at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` (ReDoc) out of the box.

4. **Type Hints**: It leverages Python's type hints to provide data validation and serialization. This allows for better editor support, including autocompletion and type checking.

5. **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, which is great for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

6. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI includes a powerful dependency injection system, making it easier to manage and share code among different parts of your application.

7. **Extensibility**: It allows easy integration with other libraries and tools, making it suitable for various projects.

FastAPI is often used for building RESTful APIs, web applications, and microservices. Its combination of speed, simplicity, and powerful features makes it a popular choice for developers looking to create robust APIs quickly.
