    #text = ("The sun set over the small town of Everwood, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets.In the heart of the town, the old clock tower chimed seven times, its echoes fading into the cool evening air. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree in the town square, where children played and laughter filled the air. Shopkeepers began closing their stores, waving goodnight to each other as they headed home. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted from the bakery, mingling with the scent of blooming flowers from Mrs. Whitakerâ€™s garden. As the stars appeared one by one in the twilight sky, the townsfolk settled into their homes, ready to rest and dream of another peaceful day in Everwood.")
